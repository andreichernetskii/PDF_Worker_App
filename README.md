# PDF worker application

## The Genesis
The inspiration for this application came from my work at the Polish local newspaper 'Czas Ostrzeszowski'. 
While working there, I wrote several Python scripts to merge each individual page of the newspaper into a single PDF file corresponding to the issue number (as part of a service to transfer newspaper issues to electronic archives of neighboring cities). I consolidated the logic of these scripts into a single Java FX application.

## Features
- Merge PDF files
- Reduce the size of the merged PDF file
